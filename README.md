## About the App

This Kanban Notes App is a dynamic, interactive task management system built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript. It features:

- A Kanban-style board with four columns: Todo, In Progress, Review, and Done
- Drag-and-drop functionality for moving notes between columns
- Ability to add new notes with a title, content, and initial status
- Random images assigned to each note for visual interest
- Responsive design with a dark/light mode toggle

Additional features include:
- A list of all notes
- A detail page for each note
- An edit page for each note
- A delete button for each note
- A search field for the list of notes
- A filter field for the list of notes
- A sort field for the list of notes
- Pagination for the list of notes
- Loading state for the list of notes
- Error state for the list of notes

## Technology Stack

- TypeScript for type-safe code
- Next.js App Router for efficient routing
- React for building user interfaces
- Shadcn UI and Radix UI for component design
- Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive design

## Code Style and Structure

- Functional and declarative programming patterns
- Modular code structure
- Descriptive variable naming
- TypeScript interfaces for type definitions
- React Server Components (RSC) for improved performance
- URL search parameter state management with 'nuqs'

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
